# OpenAPI documentation for Moodle

`tool_openapi` publishes a Moodle site's own webservice catalog as an
**OpenAPI 3.1 document**, with a bundled Swagger UI viewer and four
independent ways to control who may read it.

It documents what the site actually has installed. The catalog is built by
introspecting `external_functions`, so a plugin that adds functions adds
operations, and one that is removed takes them away. Nothing is hand-written
and nothing goes stale.

```console
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    'https://moodle.example/admin/tool/openapi/openapi.php?format=yaml'
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: My site web services
  version: 5.2.2
...
```

**Closed by default.** On a fresh install every access method is off and the
endpoint answers `403` to everyone, including you. Turning one on is a
deliberate act.

## Quick start

1. Install into `admin/tool/openapi` and visit **Site administration →
   Notifications**.
2. Go to **Site administration → Plugins → Admin tools → OpenAPI
   documentation**.
3. On **Access control**, turn on *Plugin token*, then use its cog to create
   one. Copy it — it is shown once.
4. Request the document with that token.

The long version, with what to check at each step, is in
[docs/quick-start.md](docs/quick-start.md).

## What it is not

- **Not a webservice client.** It documents the API; it does not call it for
  you. The viewer's Try it out sends requests to Moodle's own REST endpoint.
- **Not a replacement for Moodle's web services settings.** Enabling web
  services, the REST protocol, external services and their tokens all stay
  where they were. This plugin reads that configuration; it never changes it.
- **Not a way to bypass permissions.** Every access method is opt-in, and the
  one that uses an existing webservice token grants exactly what that token
  already granted.

## Requirements

Moodle 4.5 through 5.2, and whichever PHP version that Moodle release
supports. The exact matrix CI runs against is derived from
`$plugin->supported` in `version.php`.

## Bundled libraries

The viewer uses [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
(Apache 2.0), shipped under `thirdparty/swagger-ui` and declared in
`thirdpartylibs.xml`. Nothing is fetched from a CDN at runtime.

## License

[GPL v3 or later](LICENSE), the same as Moodle itself.
