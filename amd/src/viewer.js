/**
 * Rewrites a Try-it-out request to the URL Moodle actually serves.
 *
 * The document gives every function a path of its own because OpenAPI
 * cannot describe one path as many operations, but Moodle has a single REST
 * endpoint and selects the function with the wsfunction parameter. Swagger
 * UI would otherwise send the request to a path that does not exist, so the
 * path is swapped for the real endpoint while the query string -- which
 * already carries wsfunction, wstoken and moodlewsrestformat -- is kept as
 * the operation built it.
 *
 * Only operations are retargeted. Swagger UI puts the fetch of the document
 * itself through this same interceptor, and that one is already pointed at
 * the page that serves it; wsfunction is what tells the two apart, since
 * every operation declares it as a required parameter and nothing else has
 * it.
 *
 * @param {String} endpoint Absolute URL of Moodle's REST server
 * @param {Object} request The request Swagger UI is about to send
 * @returns {Object} The same request, retargeted if it is an operation
