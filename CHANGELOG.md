# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!--
.github/workflows/release.yml reads this file: when $plugin->release changes
in version.php on `main` OR on any MOODLE_XXX_STABLE branch, it looks for a
"## [<that release>]" heading below and uses everything under it, verbatim,
as the GitHub Release body. If no such heading exists yet, the release still
happens but with a generic one-line release note instead.

Keep an "## [Unreleased]" section above the latest release for changes that
have not shipped yet; rename it to "## [x.y.z]" (matching $plugin->release)
when you cut that release, and start a fresh "## [Unreleased]" above it. Each
branch keeps its own CHANGELOG.md history from the point it was cut, same as
its own $plugin->release line -- no need to reconcile entries across branches.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

First release.

### Added

- An OpenAPI 3.1 document generated from the site's own `external_functions`
  catalog, served from `admin/tool/openapi/openapi.php` as JSON or YAML, with
  `?version=3.0` for consumers that cannot read 3.1 and `?service=` to narrow
  it to one external service.
- Four independent access methods, composed with OR and all off on a fresh
  install: Moodle session, IP allowlist, tokens issued by this plugin, and
  reuse of an existing Moodle webservice token. Each can be limited to a
  chosen list of functions; a plugin token can also be limited by IP the way
  a core webservice token can.
- An admin area under Admin tools with an access control page (a switch and,
  where there is something to configure, a cog per method) and a
  documentation page (viewer, downloads, cache purge).
- An interactive viewer built on a bundled Swagger UI, whose Try it out
  sends requests to Moodle's real REST endpoint.
- Operations grouped by plugin, and core's own functions grouped by
  subsystem rather than collapsed into a single `moodle` group.
- Tokens are hashed, shown once at creation, deleted outright rather than
  flagged, and their creation and deletion are recorded in the site log.
- A privacy provider: the issuing administrator is exported without the
  token itself, and a deletion request detaches the token instead of
  destroying a credential still in use.
- Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French translations.
- An hourly scheduled task that rebuilds the cached catalog, so no request
  pays the cost of building it.
